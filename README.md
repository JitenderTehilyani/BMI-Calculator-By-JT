# BMI-Calculator-By-JT
This code creates a BMI calculator with HTML, Bootstrap, and JavaScript. The HTML defines a form for height and weight inputs, with buttons to calculate and reset. JavaScript handles form submission, validates inputs, calculates BMI, displays results, and categorizes the BMI (Underweight, Normal, Overweight, Obesity).
